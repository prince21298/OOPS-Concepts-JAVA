# Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

## Introduction & Concepts
Java is a powerful, object-oriented programming language that follows the principles of OOP. This section covers fundamental concepts.

### Classes
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of the class will have.

### Objects
Objects are instances of classes. They represent real-world entities and encapsulate data and behavior.

### Constructors
Constructors are special methods in a class used for initializing objects. They have the same name as the class and are called when an object is created.

### Keywords
Java has specific keywords that play a crucial role in defining and manipulating classes, objects, and their relationships.

## Packages, Static, Singleton Class, In-built Methods
This section explores how Java organizes classes and interfaces into packages, the use of static members, singleton class pattern, and in-built methods.

### Packages
Packages help organize classes and interfaces. They provide a way to group related classes and avoid naming conflicts.

### Static
Static members (variables and methods) belong to the class rather than instances of the class. They can be accessed without creating an object.

### Singleton Class
A Singleton class ensures that only one instance of the class is created and provides a global point of access to it.

### In-built Methods
Java provides a set of in-built methods for common tasks. Understanding and utilizing these methods is essential for efficient programming.

## Principles - Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction
This section delves into the core principles of OOP that Java supports.

### Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class to inherit the properties and behaviors of another class, promoting code reusability.

### Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type. It includes method overloading and method overriding.

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class). It restricts access to some of an object's components.

### Abstraction
Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential features they share.

## Access Control, In-built Packages, Object Class
This section covers additional aspects of Java OOP.

### Access Control
Java provides access modifiers to control the visibility of classes, methods, and variables. This helps enforce encapsulation and maintain security.

### In-built Packages
Java comes with a rich set of in-built packages that provide ready-to-use functionality for various tasks.

### Object Class
The `Object` class is the root class for all Java classes. Understanding its methods is crucial for proper class design.

## Abstract Classes, Interfaces, Annotations
Advanced OOP concepts in Java.

### Abstract Classes
Abstract classes cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods. They are designed to be extended by concrete (non-abstract) classes.

### Interfaces
Interfaces define a contract for classes to implement. They allow multiple inheritance and help achieve abstraction.

### Annotations
Annotations provide metadata about code. They are used to add information to Java code, helping in documentation and code analysis.
